## Environment Variables
- `PORT` (default: `4000`)
- `NODE_ENV` (default: `development`)
- `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)
- `JWT_SECRET` (required)
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (default: `1d`)
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` (default: `7d`)
- `PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` (default: `15m`)
- `AUTH_EXPOSE_DEBUG_TOKENS` (default: `true` in non-production)
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` (required for image uploads and Cloudinary file storage)
- `FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER` (`s3`, `local`, or `cloudinary`)
- `FILE_STORAGE_REGION`
- `FILE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `FILE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`

- `SEED_ADMIN_NAME`, `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (optional seed config)

## Auth and Role Model
- New users register as `USER`.
- `POST /auth/become-developer` creates a developer access request for admin approval.
- `ADMIN` can be seeded/managed at DB level.
- Role inheritance:
  - `DEVELOPER` can access `USER` endpoints
  - `ADMIN` can access `USER`, `DEVELOPER`, `MODERATOR`, and admin endpoints

## Standard Error Response
All errors are standardized:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "BAD_REQUEST",
    "message": "Validation error",
    "status": 400
  }
}
```

Common status codes:
- `400` bad request / validation
- `401` unauthorized / invalid token
- `403` forbidden (role/ownership)
- `404` resource not found
- `409` conflict (invalid transition, duplicate action)
